# crc32
A simple CRC32 implementation using a LUT.
Simple CRC32 implementation using a LUT which I borrowed from somewhere in the depths of the internet.
It also measures the time the compute_crc32() function takes.

I made this as an example for my information science class, so it's rather mediocre and just a proof of concept.
